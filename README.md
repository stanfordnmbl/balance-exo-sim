# balance-exo-sim

NOTE: In a previous version of this project, we refered to ankle exoskeleton
torques as 'perturbations'. The results folders are still organized using the
terminology 'unperturbed' for normal walking simulation results, and 
'perturbed' for results with exoskeleton torques applied. 'ankle_perturb_sim' is
the previous name of the repository, and therefore many files have this label.
